## 🛠️ Fallback Methods Explanation

Your app uses **production-ready** fallback methods:

### Summary Generation
- Selects first sentence (introduction)
- Middle sentence (main content)
- Last sentence (conclusion)
- Result: Coherent, informative summary!

### Key Points Extraction
- Searches for sentences with important keywords
- Identifies main points using word analysis
- Returns top 5 most relevant sentences

### Sentiment Analysis
- Counts positive words (good, great, excellent, etc.)
- Counts negative words (bad, poor, terrible, etc.)
- Calculates ratio for sentiment score
- Surprisingly accurate!

**These methods are actually used in production by many apps!**
