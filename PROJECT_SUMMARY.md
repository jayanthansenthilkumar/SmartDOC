## 🚀 Quick Start (IMPORTANT - READ THIS!)

### Step 1: Install AI Models (Required!)

The AI models (for summarization and NLP) need to be installed. Run these commands:

```powershell
# Install spaCy language model (REQUIRED)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Install transformers and torch for AI features (OPTIONAL but recommended)
pip install transformers torch sentencepiece
```

**Note:** The transformers library is LARGE (~2GB). If you want to test the app quickly without AI features first:
- The app will still work for file upload and basic text extraction
- AI summarization and sentiment analysis will show fallback messages
- You can install the AI models later

### Step 2: Create Uploads Folder

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path uploads -Force
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```powershell
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Open Your Browser

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5000**
